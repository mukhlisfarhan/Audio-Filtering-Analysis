# Audio Filtering Application

This repository contains the final project for a Signal and System (Sinyal dan Sistem) course. The project is an audio filtering application built with Python.

## Files

* `audio_filtering.py`: The main Python script for the audio filtering application. This code implements digital filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass) and visualizes the audio signal in both the time and frequency domains.
* `Laporan_Final Project_PSD.docx`: The final project report, detailing the analysis, methodology, and results of the audio filtering application.
* `voice.wav`: An example audio file used for testing the application.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mukhlisfarhan/Audio-Filtering-Analysis.git](https://github.com/mukhlisfarhan/Audio-Filtering-Analysis.git)
    cd Audio-Filtering-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project requires several Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy soundfile matplotlib scipy tkinter
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the Python script to run the GUI application:
    ```bash
    python audio_filtering.py
    ```
